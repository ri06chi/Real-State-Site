  <div class  = "article_description"> A high-rise building is defined
  by its height differently in various jurisdictions. It may be
  only residential, in which case it might also be called a 
  tower block, or it might include other functions such as 
  hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference 
  between a tower block and a skyscraper, although a building 
  with fifty or more stories is generally considered a 
  skyscraper.[2] High-rise buildings became possible with 
  the invention of the elevator (lift) and cheaper,
  more abundant building materials.

  <div class  = "article_description"> The apartment buildings are often 
  arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a 
  garden apartment shares some characteristics of a townhouseSuch garden apartment
  buildings are almost never more than three stories high, 
  since they typically lack elevators. However, the first 
  "garden apartment" buildings in New York, USA, built in 
  the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.[9][10]
  Some garden apartment buildings place a one-car garage under 
  each apartment. </div>

  <div class  = "article_description"> The vast majority of apartments
  are on one level, hence "flat". Some, however, have two storeys, 
  joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for
  this is "maisonette", as above. Some public housing in the United
  Kingdom was designed as scissor section flats. On a grander level, 
  penthouses may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of 
  space and luxury.

Two storey units in new construction are 
sometimes referred to as "townhouses".</div>

<div class  = "right_side">A desert is a barren area of landscape
 where little precipitation occurs and consequently living 
 conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of
 vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the 
 processes of denudation.  This includes much of the polar
 regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes 
 called polar deserts or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified 
 by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature 
 that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their 
 geographical location.
